/// Close a market account and recover rent
///
/// This instruction allows the founder to close their market account after:
/// 1. Market has been resolved
/// 2. Sufficient time has passed for all users to claim (e.g., 30 days after expiry)
/// 3. Pool balance is zero (all rewards distributed)
///
/// This is an optional cleanup operation that:
/// - Recovers the market PDA rent (~0.01 SOL) for the founder
/// - Removes the market from on-chain storage
/// - Keeps the blockchain clean
///
/// Requirements:
/// - Market must be resolved (not Unresolved)
/// - Must be past claim period (expiry_time + 30 days)
/// - Pool balance must be 0 (or very small dust amount)
/// - Only founder can close
///
/// Result: Market PDA closed, rent refunded to founder
