/// - Recommended: Deploy program, immediately initialize with secure wallet, then transfer admin
///
/// No hardcoded deployer check - relies on:
/// 1. Anchor's `init` constraint (prevents re-initialization)
/// 2. Race to initialize (deployer should do this immediately after deployment)
/// 3. Admin transfer capability (via set_admin instruction)
